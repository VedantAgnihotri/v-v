# Music Files

Add your MP3 files and cover image here:
- song1.mp3

The record player will display the cover image and rotate it when music is playing. The tone arm will gently bounce while the music plays.

To add music:
1. Download or save your MP3 files as song1.mp3, song2.mp3, song3.mp3
2. Add an album cover image as cover.jpeg
3. Place all files in this folder
4. The player will automatically use them

Click the record player on the bottom-right to play/pause!

Optional: If no cover.jpeg found, the disc will show a gradient color.
